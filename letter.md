**From:** Jerry Lin, Former Board Secretary (Sep 2021 \- Jun 2024\)  
**Date:** November 6, 2025

Dear Residents,

After three years of board service, I recommend voting for **Christina Gifford, Don Gustafson, and Roger Rudick**—candidates committed to collaborative problem-solving and continued operational stability.

While I respect any resident's right to run for the board, I have significant concerns about Dylan Christensen's candidacy based on documented governance patterns during his previous tenure. I believe residents deserve to understand these patterns when making their voting decision.

### Two Distinct Periods in Our Building's Recent History

**2016-2021: Operational Instability** *(Dylan and his wife Amber Gil served on the board during portions of this period: Aug 2019 \- Sep 2021 and 2015 \- Dec 2018\)*

- Five management companies over five years: Helsing, Mavericks, Titan, Action, Helsing. *(Note: I was not on the board for all of these transitions and cannot speak to the specific reasons for each change)*  
- Multiple formal complaints and legal actions consuming board resources  
- A 2021 recall effort concerning carpet installation disputes

**2021-2024: Progress and Stabilization**

- First stable management relationship in years (Citiscape)  
- Security improvements: Restored surveillance system (leading to package theft arrest), hardened entry points, upgraded to high-security keys  
- Deferred maintenance: Located missing elevator service contract, caught up on mechanical systems, addressed years of courtyard flooding

### A Pattern of Formal Legal Actions

Based on correspondence I received or witnessed as a board member, Dylan and his wife initiated the following formal actions:

**Jul 22, 2020** Amber's small claims demand that a board member "immediately step down from the Board" and be held personally financially responsible for fountain repairs.

**Sep 21, 2021** Mass email to all residents alleging "fiscal recklessness" and "massive violation of the Board's Fiduciary Duty".

**Oct 14, 2021** Additional formal complaints were filed with external agencies during this period, requiring legal resources to respond.

**Feb 16, 2022** Internal Dispute Resolution threatening: "legal action will be sought against each Board Member as an individual".

During my first five months on the board (Sep 2021 \- Feb 2022), three of these actions occurred. While residents have every right to raise concerns through appropriate channels, this concentration of formal legal actions involving threats of personal liability against volunteer board members occurred during a critical period when the board was addressing urgent security issues and years of deferred maintenance.

All referenced documents are attached for your independent review.

### Addressing Campaign Claims

Dylan's campaign flyer raises several issues that deserve factual context:

**Rising Dues**: Like HOAs nationwide, we face inflationary pressures affecting energy, insurance, materials, and labor. According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://ycharts.com/indicators/san_franciscooaklandsan_jose_ca_consumer_price_index_unadjusted), the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward area has experienced a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 20% from 2018-2024. Notably, the attached Dec 2018 letter from Titan Management acknowledged that "assessments had not significantly increased in the prior 12 years despite rising costs, and that the HOA had been operating at a loss for three years." The current board has implemented competitive bidding and expense controls to mitigate future increases.

**Property Values**: According to [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/city/13654/CA/Oakland/housing-market), Oakland's median condo prices declined approximately 28% between 9/2020 and 9/2025. These are market-wide factors affecting properties throughout Oakland, not just our building.

**The Fountain:** According to building records and resident correspondence, the courtyard fountain ceased functioning in Sep 2019\. The attached July 2020 correspondence shows Amber Gil demanding fountain repairs at that time. Dylan served on the board from Aug 2019 through Sep 2021, but I cannot speak to what actions, if any, were attempted regarding fountain repairs during that period, as I was not on the board until Sep 2021\. When the board I served on investigated fountain restoration, we discovered improper waterproofing (paint instead of membrane lining) and damaged wiring that significantly complicated repairs.

**Transparency HOA**: Dylan identifies himself as founder of "Transparency HOA," a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. According to the California Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts (accessible at [https://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y,](https://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y) registration \#CT0273858), this organization's status shows as "Delinquent" with the last filing dated May 11, 2022\. I encourage voters to verify this information independently using the link provided.

### Management Company Turnover: The Objective Evidence

One indicator of the governance challenges during that period is our building's management history. Professional management companies work with dozens of HOAs—they don't terminate accounts lightly, as it costs them revenue. Yet our building went through five management companies over five years (2016-2021).

Since Aug 2023, we've maintained the same management company for over two years—the first stable professional relationship in recent building history. This stability has enabled us to address deferred maintenance, improve security systems, implement competitive bidding, and engage in long-term planning.

**What changed?** In my observation, the current board has focused on problem-solving, finding common ground, and maintaining a constructive relationship with management. While I cannot attribute the prior turnover to any single factor, the contrast in stability is notable.

### Looking Forward

Christina Gifford, Don Gustafson, and Roger Rudick are committed to building on our recent stability while addressing legitimate resident concerns about costs and property maintenance. I know this from our time as fellow board members in lieu of many **differences of opinion**.

I encourage you to review the attached documents and consider which governance approach will best serve our community going forward.

The choice is yours. I hope this information helps you make an informed decision.

Sincerely,

Jerry Lin
Former Board Secretary

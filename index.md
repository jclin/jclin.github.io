# Hi there

As a former board director and 10-year resident of our community, I've experienced firsthand how import board elections are, but this year feels particularly consequential for our neighborhood's future. Having served on the board, I understand the complexity of the decisions our directors face and the impact they have on our daily lives. I wanted to take a moment to share some context about our building's recent history—especially for newer residents who may be unfamiliar with what we've navigated together—and to discuss patterns of behavior I've observed from Dylan Christensen, both as a longtime resident and during my time as a board director.

Sincerely,  
Jerry Lin  
Former Board Secretary (Sep 2021 - Jun 2024)

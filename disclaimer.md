This letter represents my personal perspective based on my three years of experience as a board member (Sep 2021 \- Jun 2024). I have made every effort to ensure the accuracy of factual statements, which are supported by attached documentation or based on my direct knowledge. Where I express opinions, interpretations, or characterizations, I have identified them as such.

I am writing in my personal capacity as a concerned homeowner and former board member. I do not represent the current board, any candidate, or the HOA. These opinions are my own. If any factual statement in this letter is inaccurate, I welcome corrections and will issue an amendment.

I encourage all residents to review the attached documents, ask questions of all candidates, and make their own informed decisions about who will best serve our community.
